permalink: /publication/2022-08-04-Airy
excerpt: "We prove that certain 'ladder' sequences of spherical harmonics are Lagrangian distributions whose semi-classical $L^2$ mass lies over a band around the standard equator of $S^2$ bounded by latitude circles which are caustics. We derive Airy scaling asymptotics for such sequences in a shrinking neighborhood of these caustic latitudes."
