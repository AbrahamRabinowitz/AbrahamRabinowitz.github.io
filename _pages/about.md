I am a mathematician, data scientist and quantum computing researcher working on the quantum computing team in the Innovation Group at State Farm. .  

I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of Steve Zelditch. My thesis is entitled [Scaling Asymptotics of Szego Kernels and Concentration of Husimi Distributions on Grauert Tubes](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/qr46r123s?locale=en)

I am interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science including but not limited to 
- Applications of quantum computing to optimization, algorithms, data science and machine learning. 
- Applications of geometric analysis to data science and machine learning.
- Mathematics of Quantum Information Theory.
