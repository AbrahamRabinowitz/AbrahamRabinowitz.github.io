I am a mathematician, data scientist and open source developer interested in bringing my deep research and technical experience to tackle data driven problems.

I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of Steve Zelditch. My thesis is entitled [Scaling Asymptotics of Szego Kernels and Concentration of Husimi Distributions on Grauert Tubes](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/qr46r123s?locale=en)

I am interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science including but not limited to 
- Efficient implementations of machine learning algorithms and data pipelines. 
- Quantum Computing for efficient simulation of quantum systems.
- Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations and Science.
- Applications of geometric analysis to machine learning.
