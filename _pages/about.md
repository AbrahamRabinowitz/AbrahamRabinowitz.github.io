I am a mathematician and data scientist seeking machine learning and data engineering roles.

In August, 2022, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of Steve Zelditch. My thesis is entitled [Empirical Measures for Integrable Eigenfunctions Restricted to Invariant Curves.](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/dj52w5081)

I am interested in the theory of manifold learning and applicatons of spectral theory to deep learning. My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of geometry, semi-classical analysis, probability, and spectral theory.
